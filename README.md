# Overview

With this software I was trying to learn how to use GIS mapping techniques, specifically how to use arcGIS with a javaScript web app. This program displays a map of the United States and shows states where I've lived in green and states where I've visited in blue. Along with the color coordination there is a popup that displays the name of the state and the year(s) I was there.

# Development Environment

I used VS code as my IDE, or programming environment.
I wrote the code in html5, css, and JavaScript.
I also used arcGIS toutorials and code to create the map.

# Useful Websites

* [ArcGIS](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/display-a-map/)
* [Kaggle for datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeffreybraun/chipotle-locations)


# Future Work

* Pull state location from cvs or json file
* Make it dynamic, dropdown to select what is selected on the map
